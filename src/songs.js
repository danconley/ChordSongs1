All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
C        G        D
I'm standing here outside your door
C        G        D
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
C        G        D
But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn
C        G        D
The taxi's waiting, he's blowing his horn
C        G        D
Already I'm so lonesome I could die

G        C        D
So kiss me and smile for me
G        C        D
Tell me that you'll wait for me
G        C        D
Hold me like you'll never let me go
G        C        D
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
G        C        D
Don't know when I'll be back again
G        C        D
Oh babe, I hate to go`,

I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
C        G        Am        F
I fell right through the cracks

Before the cool done run out, I'll be giving it my bestest
C        G        Am        F
And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
C        G        Am        F
I reckon it's again my turn
C        G        Am        F
To win some or learn some

C        G        Am        F
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
C        G        Am        F
