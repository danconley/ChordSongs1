    lyrics: `C        G        D
All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
C        G        D
I'm standing here outside your door
C        G        D
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
C        G        D
But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn
C        G        D
The taxi's waiting, he's blowing his horn
C        G        D
Already I'm so lonesome I could die

G        C        D
So kiss me and smile for me
G        C        D
Tell me that you'll wait for me
G        C        D
Hold me like you'll never let me go
G        C        D
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
G        C        D
Don't know when I'll be back again
G        C        D
Oh babe, I hate to go`,

    lyrics: `Em                D6add9/F#
On the first part of the journey
Em                D6add9/F#
I was looking at all the life
Em                D6add9/F#
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
Em                D6add9/F#
There was sand and hills and rings

Em                D6add9/F#
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
Em                D6add9/F#
And the sky with no clouds
Em                D6add9/F#
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
Em                D6add9/F#
But the air was full of sound

Em                D6add9/F#
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
Em                D6add9/F#
It felt good to be out of the rain
Em                D6add9/F#
In the desert you can remember your name
Em                D6add9/F#
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain`,

    lyrics: `C        G        Am        F
Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
C        G        Am        F
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
C        G        Am        F
I fell right through the cracks
C        G        Am        F
And now I'm trying to get back

C        G        Am        F
Before the cool done run out, I'll be giving it my bestest
C        G        Am        F
And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
C        G        Am        F
I reckon it's again my turn
C        G        Am        F
To win some or learn some

C        G        Am        F
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
C        G        Am        F
It cannot wait, I'm yours`,

Don't worry about a thing

Rise up this mornin', smiled with the risin' sun

Three little birds pitch by my doorstep
A        D        E
Singin' sweet songs of melodies pure and true
A        D        E
Sayin', "This is my message to you-ou-ou"

Hey, where did we go
G        C        G        D
Days when the rains came
G        C        G        D
Down in the hollow
G        C        G        D
Playing a new game

G        C        G        D
Laughing and a-running, hey, hey
G        C        G        D
Skipping and a-jumping
G        C        G        D
In the misty morning fog with
G        C        G        D
Our hearts a-thumping and you

G        C        G        D
My brown-eyed girl

You, my brown-eyed girl`,
